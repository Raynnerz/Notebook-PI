For example, the controller could communicate directly with a database
 (like MySQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.) to obtain the requested
 data and return a response, via the views, with the appropriate data in the
 appropriate format (like HTML or JSON). Or perhaps the end userâ€™s request is for a
  resource that does not exist - in which case the controller will respond with a 404 error.
